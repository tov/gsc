There needs to be a symlink from html/resources to the resources
directory in the Wt source tree.

## Link errors

To avoid link errors, GSC and Wt need to be compiled with the same C++
standard. GSC uses C++17, so we need to configure Wt to use C++17 as
well. You can do this by passing CMake `DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17` when
configuring the project:

```console
$ cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```
